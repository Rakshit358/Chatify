# Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a real-time chat application built using React for the front end, Node.js and Express for the backend, and Socket.IO for instant messaging. The application allows users to send and receive messages instantly. In future updates, we plan to add features such as group chats and private rooms.

## Features

-   Instant messaging using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
-   Real-time updates of messages
-   Clean and responsive UI built with React
-   Future updates:
    -   Group chats
    -   Private rooms

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express
-   **WebSocket**: Socket.IO

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

-   Node.js ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))
-   npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
    cd chat-application` 
    
2.  **Install dependencies**
    
    Navigate to the `client` and `server` directories and install the necessary dependencies.
    
    For the frontend:
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd client
    npm install` 
    
    For the backend:
    Copy code
    
    `cd ../server
    npm install` 
    

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server**
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd server
    npm start` 
    
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.
    
2.  **Start the frontend application**
    
    Open a new terminal and run:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `cd client
    npm start` 
    
    The React app will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
    

## Project Structure

### Frontend (React)

The frontend code is located in the `client` directory and follows the standard Create React App structure. Key components and files include:

-   `src/components`: Contains React components
-   `src/App.js`: Main application component
-   `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application

### Backend (Node.js, Express, Socket.IO)

The backend code is located in the `server` directory. Key files include:

-   `script.js`: Entry point of the backend application
-   `controllers/chatController.js`: Contains logic for chat functionality

## Usage

1.  **Open the application in your browser**
    
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the chat application.
    
2.  **Send and receive messages**
    
    -   Type a message in the input field and press enter to send.
    -   Messages will appear in real-time in the chat window.

## Future Plans

-   **Group Chats**: Enable users to create and join group chats.
-   **Private Rooms**: Allow users to create private rooms for confidential conversations.
